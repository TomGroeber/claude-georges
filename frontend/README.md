## Project info
# Vacation Management System - Website Overview

## Introduction:
Welcome to the **Vacation Management System** â€“ a streamlined platform designed to help organizations efficiently manage employee leave requests. The system is divided into two main portals: the **Admin Panel** and the **Employee Portal**, each offering distinct features to suit the needs of both administrators and employees.

---

## Admin Panel:
The **Admin Panel** provides administrators with full control over employee leave management. Key features include:
- **Employee Management**: Admins can easily add, update, or remove employee records.
- **Leave Requests Management**: Admins can review and process employee leave applications, either **approving** or **rejecting** leave requests.
- **Leave History Tracking**: Admins can view the complete leave history for all employees, providing transparency and easy access to past leave data.

---

## Employee Portal:
The **Employee Portal** is designed for employees to manage their leave requests and view their leave history. Key features include:
- **Leave History**: Employees can view their past leave requests and status, helping them keep track of their leave entitlements.
- **Apply for Leave**: Employees can submit new leave requests, choosing the type of leave and the dates, making the process seamless and easy.

---

With this system, both employees and admins can efficiently manage and track leave requests, ensuring smooth vacation planning and compliance with organizational policies.
